                                    The galaxy, called M91, is located approximately 55 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Coma Berenices. It is a barred spiral galaxy, boasting a prominent central bar-shaped structure composed of bright stars.

                                    However, behind the galaxy's central bar lies a behemoth black hole that weighs somewhere between 9.6 and 38 million times as much as the sun, according to a statement from the European Space Agency (ESA), which is a partner on the Hubble Space Telescope.

                                    Even when the space rocks reached Japan, the traveling wasn't quite over. That's because some of the asteroid material had another flight to catch in order to reach NASA's Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) center at Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Texas.

                                    This trip didn't need any rocket fuel, but that doesn't mean it was easy. "This one is, I would say, a really big deal," Keiko Nakamura-Messenger, who until last month was a cosmochemist at JSC, told Space.com. "This is the first time that we did international samples li
                                    ke this."

                                    Hayabusa2 was more successful, bringing 0.2 ounces (5.4 grams) — 50 times the target amount — of precious asteroid cargo to Earth in a capsule that landed in the Australian desert in December 2020. As a partner on the mission, NASA was to receive 10% of that to add to its collection of moon rocks, meteorites and other celestial material held at JSC.

                                hirty alien comets have been spotted transiting the young star Beta Pictoris, their long tails lighting up the skies of the fledgling planets forming there

                                <Typography paragraph>.

The comet discovery has been made using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which watches for dips in starlight as planetary bodies pass in front of — or transit — their star. Beta Pictoris, which is 63.4 light years away, is home to a dusty planet-forming disk that was discovered back in 1983 by IRAS, the Infrared Astronomy Satellite. The disk contains at least two planets, both gas giants, and spectral observations gathered as long ago as 1987 suggested evidence for comets (or 'falling evaporating bodies' as they were referred to at the time) releasing dust and gas into the disk. 

In 2019, astronomers led by Sebastian Zieba, of the University of Innsbruck in Austria, used TESS to discover three 'exocomets' transiting Beta Pictoris. Now, another team, led by astronomer Alain Lecavelier des Etangs, of the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris in France, has observed 30 exocomets in the Beta Pictoris system, including the three previously discovered.

An Earth-size planet has been spotted orbiting a nearby star at a distance that would makes it not too hot and not too cold — comfortable enough for life to exist, researchers announced today (Sept. 29).

If confirmed, the exoplanet, named Gliese 581g,  would be the first Earth-like world found residing in a star's habitable zone a region where a planet's temperature could sustain liquid water on its surface.
